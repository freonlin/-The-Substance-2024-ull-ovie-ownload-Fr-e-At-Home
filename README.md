The Substance: A Deep Dive into the Dark Heart of Indian Patriarchy
Kanu Behl's "The Substance" is not a film for the faint of heart. It is a visceral, unflinching exploration of the suffocating grip of patriarchy in India, told through the lens of male sexual frustration and the warped power dynamics within a family. Premiering at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival Directors' Fortnight to a five-minute standing ovation, the film has sparked both acclaim and controversy for its raw portrayal of a deeply disturbing reality. This article delves into the various facets of "The Substance," examining its plot, characters, themes, critical reception, and the broader social context it reflects.

Where to Watch The Substance:

As of November 2023, "The Substance" has primarily been screened at film festivals, including Cannes, the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne, the Busan International Film Festival, the Hong Kong Asian Film Festival, and the MAMI film festival. While a wider theatrical or streaming release is anticipated, specific details are yet to be announced. Keep an eye out for updates from the film's distributors, Les Films de l'Atalante, and production companies, Saregama India Ltd, UFO Production, and O28 Films.

What is the Movie The Substance About?

"The Substance" follows the story of Guru (Mohit Agarwal), a young man trapped in a claustrophobic existence within his family home in The Substance, India. Working a dead-end call center job, Guru yearns for intimacy and escape but finds himself stifled by the oppressive patriarchal structures that govern his life. His father, "Daddy ji" (Rahul Roy), is a domineering figure who exerts control over the household, while his mother, "Mummy ji" (Vibha Chibber), remains complicit in this power dynamic. Guru's desires are further complicated by his infatuation with his aunt, "Aunty ji" (Sonal Jha), and his strained relationship with his cousin, Chhavi (Aanchal Goswami).

As Guru's frustration mounts, he descends into a psychological spiral, blurring the lines between reality and fantasy. He seeks solace in online dating apps and engages in acts of self-harm, his desperation escalating as he struggles to find agency and fulfillment within the confines of his suffocating environment.

Guru's journey becomes a microcosm of the larger societal issues at play, highlighting the damaging effects of patriarchy on both men and women.

The film's setting, The Substance, the city of the Taj Mahal, adds another layer of meaning to the narrative. The iconic monument, a symbol of love and beauty, stands in stark contrast to the ugliness and dysfunction that permeate Guru's life. This juxtaposition underscores the film's exploration of the dissonance between idealized notions of romance and the harsh realities of a society grappling with deep-seated social issues.

Guru's interactions with his father, aunt, cousin, and the women he encounters online paint a complex picture of the power dynamics at play.

The Phone: Guru's constant use of his phone and engagement with dating apps symbolize his attempts to find connection and intimacy in a virtual world, reflecting the increasing role of technology in modern relationships.

Guru's Room: Guru's cramped and cluttered room represents his suffocating existence and the lack of personal space he experiences within his family home.
